# Pixel Art Generator

### Overview

The app provides a way to select from some pre-defined colors and click on empty "pixels" to change their background color to match the selected palette color. There is also an input field where you can add your own custom colors to the palette. There is a link to W3School's CSS color list for reference.


### Future Plans

- refactor app's JavaScript functions for clarity
- refactor app to use a front-end framework
- Prevent the addition of empty color palette options
